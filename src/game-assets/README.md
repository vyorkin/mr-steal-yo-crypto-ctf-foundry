# Challenge #3 - Game Assets

GG labs just released their nOtApOnZi game that allows multiple WLed NFTs to be used as in-game items.

To integrate the multiple ERC721 tokens, they have a wrapper contract (ERC1155) that wraps the NFTs, allowing them to be used in-game. Users can also unwrap their NFTs when they are done using them.

Your task is to grief users by trapping their NFTs inside the wrapper contract and making them irretrievable.
