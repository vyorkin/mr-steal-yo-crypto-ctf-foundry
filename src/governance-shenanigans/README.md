# Challenge #10 - Governance Shenanigans

The `NotSushiToken` governance token contract has been launched,
which was configured to determine who should be named the best sushi chef.
Who wouldn't want that clout?

It only allows `WLed` addresses to vote.
Luckily your sybil attack has yielded you 3 `WLed` addresses capable of voting.

Your goal is to get the most delegated votes and crown yourself the true sushi king.
You start with 500 tokens, your competition has 2,000.
