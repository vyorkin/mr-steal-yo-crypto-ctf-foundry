# Challenge 04 - Free Lunch

SafuSwap has just launched their sexy new UniswapV2 fork.

It includes a SafuMakerV2 contract which is tasked with converting protocol trading fees to SAFU, its farm token, for later distribution to SAFU stakers.

You start with 100 USDC and 100 SAFU, and your task is to increase your balance of both tokens by at least 50x through draining SafuSwap's funds.
