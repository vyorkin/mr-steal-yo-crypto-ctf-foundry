# Challenge #9 - Inflationary Net Worth

Thereâ€™s a `MasterChef` contract which accepts MULA tokens and mints MUNY as rewards to stakers.

MULA has a deflationary transfer tax mechanism which burns 5% of each transfer, in order to properly incentivize long term holders.

Your task is to trick `MasterChef` into minting you all the MUNY allocated to all stakers.
You start with 10,000 MULA.
