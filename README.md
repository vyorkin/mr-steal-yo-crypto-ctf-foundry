A set of challenges to learn offensive security of smart contracts.
Featuring interesting challenges loosely (or directly) inspired by real world exploits.

## How To Play üïπÔ∏è

1.  **Install Foundry**

First run the command below to get foundryup, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your PATH, run it to get the latest forge and cast binaries:

```console
foundryup
```

Advanced ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found in the [foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md)

2. **Clone This Repo and install dependencies**

```
git clone https://github.com/vyorkin/mr-steal-your-crypto-ctf-foundry.git
cd mr-steal-your-crypto-ctf-foundry
forge install
```

3. **Code your solutions in the provided `[NAME_OF_THE_LEVEL].t.sol` files (inside each level's folder in the test folder)**
4. **Run your exploit for a challenge**

```
make [CONTRACT_LEVEL_NAME]
```

or

```
./run.sh [LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME]
./run.sh [CHALLENGE_NUMBER]
./run.sh [4_FIRST_LETTER_OF_NAME]
```

If the challenge is executed successfully, you've passed!üôåüôå

### Tips and tricks ‚ú®

- In all challenges you must use the account called attacker. In Forge, you can use the [cheat code](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/tree/master/forge#cheat-codes) `prank` or `startPrank`.
- To code the solutions, you may need to refer to [Forge docs](https://onbjerg.github.io/foundry-book/forge/index.html).
- In some cases, you may need to code and deploy custom smart contracts.
